We are interested in studying the contributions of reactive nitrogen emissions from agricultural and fossil fuel combustion—specifically ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrate (NO3-)—to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), water eutrophication, and climate change. Our interdisciplinary research group aims to effectively manage reactive nitrogen pollution while addressing the growing food and energy demands. This issue is essential for achieving major national strategic goals, such as clean air, carbon neutrality, and sustainable agricultural development.
