Urban NH3 emission quantifications include a great deal of uncertainties. [Xu, Lu, Guo* ES&T 2023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c05266) explored reasons for severe WRF-Chem model underestimations of NH3 concentrations in Beijing in August 2018, including simulated gas-particle partitioning, meteorology, regional transport, and emissions, using updated spatially refined (3 km resolution) NH3 emission estimates in the agricultural sector for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and in the traffic sector for Beijing. We find that simulated NH3 concentrations are significantly lower than ground-based and satellite observations during August and both agricultural and non-agricultural NH3 emission totals in Beijing shall increase by âˆ¼5 times to match the observations. Our research demonstrates the need of locating missing emission sources for urban NH3 and increasing efforts for validating inventories and simulated NHx.
