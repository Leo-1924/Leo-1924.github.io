"I am a third cohort MPhil student at HKUST (GZ). My research interests lie primarily in biogeochemistry and sustainable agriculture. My motivation for pursuing research comes from the understanding that my work can benefit future generations. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on nutrient leaching during flood events, utilizing stable isotopes and time-series analysis."
