I am interested in the physics of the ocean and the ocean's role in our climate system, as well as numerical methods that efficiently solve problems in these areas. In particular, I study the physics of small scale processes at the air-sea interface, such as boundary layer turbulence, ocean surface waves and the resulting ocean mixing. I develop physically-based parameterizations to describe their effects on larger scale processes in climate models and assess their impact on the regional and global climate. I also explore novel approaches to improve the efficiency of numerical models for studying the interactions between physical processes across scales, such as GPU-accelerated computing and multiscale modeling.

I am currently a postdoc research associate in the [Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/fluid-dynamics-solid-mechanics/index.php){:target="_blank"} division at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov){:target="_blank"}, working on the [Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org){:target="_blank"} project. I received my PhD in 2018 from the [Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/){:target="_blank"} at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Baylor Fox-Kemper](http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/){:target="_blank"}. See my PhD dissertation [here](publications.html#pdfthesis). Before that I received a master's degree in Meteorology from the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Haijun Yang](https://aos.fudan.edu.cn/72/b0/c14809a225968/page.htm){:target="_blank"}. See more in my [CV](pdf/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
