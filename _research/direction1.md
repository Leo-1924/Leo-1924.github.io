Dietary structure drives agricultural production and associated environmental damages. During the past decades, Chinese diets have shifted towards more resource-intensive diets and we also face rising premature deaths attributable to dietary risks. Combining dietary surveys, atmospheric chemistry models and life cycle analyses, [Guo et al. One Earth 2022] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.02.002) examines four potential future Chinese dietary shifts and their implications for agricultural NH3 emissions and PM2.5 levels, greenhouse gas emissions, water footprints and human health impacts associated with dietary intakes and exposure PM2.5. Complex trade-offs in various environmental and health objectives embedded in dietary changes are unveiled.
