Trained primarily in atmospheric chemistry, our research group conducts interdisciplinary research combing atmospheric science, agronomy, environmental economics and health that are environmental policy-relevant and innovative. 
Our research focuses on the nexus of human society, nitrogen cycle and atmospheric environment, particularly, we are interested in technological and policy opportunities that better align multiple environmental/health objectives. Rising reactive nitrogen emissions from agricultural and fossil fuel combustion—specifically ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrate (NO3-), as a result of human perturbation to the Earth’s N cycle, leads to cascading environmental damages including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), water eutrophication, and climate change. How could we balance the need for development and environmental integrity? Through the lenses of reactive nitrogen management, we explore pathways towards major national and global strategic goals, such as clean air, carbon neutrality, and sustainable agricultural development.
