I am interested in the physics of the ocean and the ocean's role in our climate system, as well as numerical methods that efficiently solve problems in these areas. In particular, I study the physics of small scale processes at the air-sea interface, such as boundary layer turbulence, ocean surface waves and the resulting ocean mixing. I develop physically-based parameterizations to describe their effects on larger scale processes in climate models and assess their impact on the regional and global climate. I also explore novel approaches to improve the efficiency of numerical models for studying the interactions between physical processes across scales, such as GPU-accelerated computing and multiscale modeling.

I am currently a postdoc research associate in the [Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/fluid-dynamics-solid-mechanics/index.php)
division at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov), working on the <a href="https://e3sm.org" target="_blank">Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)</a>
project.
I received my PhD in 2018 from the
<a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences</a> at
<a href="https://www.brown.edu" target="_blank">Brown University</a>, working with <a href="http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/" target="_blank">Prof. Baylor Fox-Kemper</a>.
