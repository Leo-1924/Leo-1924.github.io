With ongoing climate mitigation efforts, the role of reactive nitrogen in future PM2.5 formation becomes complicated by changing interactions with other air pollutants. Guo et al One Earth 2024 provides a modeling analysis and demonstrates that with clean energy transitions, deeper ammonia controls are required to be effective for PM2.5 mitigation, while the effectiveness of nitrogen oxide controls is unaffected. The later NH3 controls are installed, the deeper the required reductions will be to be effective, although for many regions such levels are still within technical feasibility, while NOx controls will always remain effective. These insights provide an important guide to ensure that clean air policies are as efficient as possible.
