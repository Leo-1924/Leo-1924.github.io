From a food system perspective, 1/3 of global food production is lost during post-harvesting, storage, transportation, retail and consumption processes. Food loss & waste (FLW) represent resources wasted and opportunities lost to secure food supply. Combining latest FLW database, food-level agricultural NH3 emission inventory, and atmospheric chemistry models, [Guo et al. Nature Food 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00810-0) found that global FLW were associated with 16% anthropogenic NH3 emissions, and addressing FLW provides overlooked benefits for improving PM2.5 air quality, mitigating excess nitrogen deposition to sensitive ecosystems, thus benefiting human and ecosystem health. Synergies among multiple sustainable development goals are emphasized, including Responsible Consumption and Production, Human health and wellbeing, Life on Land, etc.
