Ammonia (NH3) emissions contribute substantially to secondary inorganic aerosol formations in PM2.5. Relatively poor agricultural nitrogen management in China, has led to high NH3 emissions from agricultural fields, as well as nitrogen water pollution, N2O emissions and low nitrogen use efficiency. Combining agronomic data, process-based emission models & atmospheric chemistry model, [Guo et al. Nature Food 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00162-z) finds that easy-to-implement agricultural management practices can reduce agricultural NH3 emissions in China by 34%, while mitigating PM2.5 air pollution, increasing crop yields and reducing nitrogen water pollution and climate impacts. Total benefits valued at $30 billion/a exceed costs of $18 billion/a. Policy implications are there exist strong synergies for Chinaâ€™s clean air, climate and high-efficiency high-yield agricultural policies.
