Energy and food production, essential to human wellbeing, generate reactive nitrogen emissions including (NOx, N2O, NH3, etc). [Guo et al. Science Advances 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado0112) combined integrated assessment models, atmospheric chemistry transport models, dose-response relationships and explored opportunities of implementing additional nitrogen specific policies for improving future air quality and ecosystem health. Maximum technical/policy feasible mitigation potentials of agricultural NH3 and anthropogenic NOx emissions have been assessed. The role of managing nitrogen for improving future global PM2.5 & O3 air quality, mitigate nitrogen deposition, thus protecting human, crop and ecosystem health has been emphasized.
